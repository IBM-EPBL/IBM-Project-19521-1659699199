### Web UI

### HTML

The most fundamental component of the Web is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It describes the purpose and organisation of web content. Links that join online pages together, either inside a single website or between websites, are referred to as "hypertext." An essential component of the Web are links. You can participate actively in the World Wide Web by publishing content online and linking it to other people's web pages.

### CSS

A stylesheet language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to specify how a document written in HTML or XML is presented (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS specifies how items should be shown in various media, including speech, paper, screens, and other media. According to W3C guidelines, CSS is one of the basic languages of the open web and is standardised across all Web browsers.

### JS

Although it is most famous for being the scripting language for Web pages, JavaScript (commonly abbreviated to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions that is also utilised in other non-browser applications. It is a dynamic, prototype-based multi-paradigm scripting language that supports imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms.

JavaScript, which operates on the client side of the web, may be used to plan or programme how web pages should act in response to an event. JavaScript is a popular scripting language for managing the behaviour of web pages because it is simple to learn and extremely effective.

### Web Framework

Web application developers can write applications without having to be concerned about low-level details like protocol, thread management, and other issues thanks to a web framework, also known as a web application framework.

### Flask
 
Python is used to create the Flask web application framework. It was created by Armin Ronacher, who served as the team leader of Poocco, a worldwide group of Python aficionados. The Werkzeg WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine serve as the foundation for Flask. They're both Pocco projects. Its core is compact and simple to expand.

### Pickle

Pickle is primarily used in Python to serialise and deserialize Python object structures. To put it another way, it is the procedure of converting a Python object into a byte stream so that it can be stored in a file or database, have its state preserved across sessions, or be used to transfer data over a network.
